> The Abhidhamma Pitaka (Pali; English: Basket of Higher Doctrine) is the last of the three pitakas (Pali for "baskets") constituting the Pali Canon, the scriptures of Theravāda Buddhism.The Abhidhamma Pitaka is a detailed scholastic analysis and summary of the Buddha's teachings in the Suttas. Here the suttas are reworked into a schematized system of general principles that might be called 'Buddhist Psychology'. In the Abhidhamma the generally dispersed teachings and principles of the suttas are organized into a coherent science of Buddhist doctrine.
The other two collections are the Sutta Pitaka and the Vinaya Pitaka. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhidhamma_Pitaka)
